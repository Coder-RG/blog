*At the foot of a mountainous trail I stood,*  
*trying to see as far as I could,*  
*eager to know what lies ahead,*  
*with some fear in my head.*  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

*Started my journey up the trail,*  
*a sense of dissent that prevails.*  
*Walking on the track afraid,*  
*felt no one to my aid.*  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

*Belived myself and walked alone,*  
*to a sense someone else felt the same.*  
*Always believed that it was just a game,*  
*where it is okay to fail.*

*Walking for miles there I stood,*  
*At the apex; At the foot.*  
*Gazing out as far as I could.*  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

*Many more people walk the trail,*  
*all at the same place, yet so far away.*  
*This is just a game, 'The game of life',*  
*where it is okay to fail.*

Hey There!

Myself Rishabh Goel, I am the author of all posts on this blog.
I find Reinforcement Learning very interesting and decided to document
my journey through a blog. Learning-by-teaching is a famous concept and
it might just help someone along the way. Hope you found this blog helpful.
