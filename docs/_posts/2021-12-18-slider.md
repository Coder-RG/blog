This is the first article under Reinforcement Learning. Today, we will look at
[Slider], a simple example for understanding [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning). Hopefully, you will have a clear understanding after reading this article.

## Environment

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Slider_env]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/env1.png)
{: refdef}

Our environment is a grid of 7 columns. **S** is the Start state and **G** is the goal state.
The agent can only move left or right. When the agent arrives at *G* the game ends.

{: refdef}

*Rewards*
- +1 for moving towards *G*
- -10 on illegal step
- +10 on reaching *G*
