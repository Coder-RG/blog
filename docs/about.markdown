Hey There!

If you are viewing my blog then you must be interested in reinforcement learning(Yay!). I hope you liked what you read. I once pursued an online course on reinforcement learning and instantly developed an interest. If you too are willing to get your foot in, then I would suggest a [kaggle course][kaggle-course] on reinforcement learning. This is a great course in which you learn through practical experience.

>*At the foot of a mountainous trail I stood,*  
*trying to see as far as I could,*  
*eager to know what lies ahead,*  
*with some fear in my head.*  
>
>*Started my journey up the trail,*  
*a sense of dissent that prevails.*  
*Walking on the track afraid,*  
*felt no one to my aid.*  
>
>*Belived myself and walked alone,*  
*to a sense someone else felt the same.*  
*Always believed that it was just a game,*  
*where it is okay to fail.*

>*Walking for miles there I stood,*  
*At the apex; At the foot.*  
*Gazing out as far as I could.*  
>
>*Many more people walk the trail,*  
*all at the same place, yet so far away.*  
*This is just a game, 'The game of life',*  
*where it is okay to fail.
